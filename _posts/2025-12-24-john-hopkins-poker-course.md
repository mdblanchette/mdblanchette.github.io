# Lecture 1

## Some Types of Poker Players

**Whale**: Super rich guy playing to be popular and not to win &rarr; You want them on your table

**Donkey**: Thinks he's good but is horrible, doesn't know anything about the game but just plays a lot &rarr; You want them on your table

**Fish**: Passive, never aggressive, never minds calling but never raises. Very easy to play against them. &rarr; You want them on your table

**Shark**: Super good players you want to look out for.

## Be the House

Casinos are in business because they always have an edge in the games they offer. Your goal in poker is to "be the house". You want to be in situations when you have the edge no matter the level of cash. How to get that edge: Learn skills, fundamentals, get lots of experience. **Ask yourself: "Do I have an edge against this player?" If not &rarr; LEAVE!** Try to go for tables where you have an edge.

## Two Types of Big Straight Draws


Double Belly Buster: When two different cards give you a straight using different board cards.

Example:

You have 7&diams; 6&hearts; and the flop is 5&diams; 9&hearts; 3&spades;.

There are two card ranks (8 cards) that give you a straight &rarr; Any 4 and any 8.

You have a **disguised** hand which is **very strong**. No one really thinks much if a 4 lands on the board but you know it will be massive for you.

## Cool (and Useful) Facts

* You cannot make a full house or better without a pair on the board.
* You cannot make a flush without 3 to a suit on the board.
* Straights are a little tricky to identify - Few unpaired boards can't have a straight.
* You can't have a straight without a 5 or a 10.
* Bottom two pair is a vulnerable hand - If a higher card pairs on the board you are counterfeited.

## Chip Stacks

**Effective Stack**: You can only bet chips in your stack.

Player A: 1500

Player B: 800

Player C: 2300

If they all go All In, Player B can only win 1600 at most.

**Side Pots**

If all 3 players go All In (when B has best hand, A has second best hand):

* Player B wins 2400 (including their original 800)
* Player A wins "Side Pot" of 1400
* Player C gets 800 back

# Lecture 2

## Expected Value

When flipping a house, expected value is sale price - cost of rehab and commissions.

It's a similar thought process in poker:

Expected value = How much you can win - How much you can lose

More accurately:

Expected value = (How much you win) * (Probability of winning) + (How much you lose) * (Probability of losing)

**Key to poker: Push your positive expectations and fold your negative expectations.**

### EV in Action

Your hand: A &clubs; 3 &clubs;

Board (After turn): K &clubs; 7 &diams; 4 &spades; J &clubs;

Pot: $50

You have $20, opponent has $20 and bets $20.

You know your opponent is tight and would only do this with 2 pair or better.

**Should you call or fold?**

**Fold**: EV is 0

**Call**:

* You need a club to have a good chance of winning.
* Clubs left in the deck: 13 - 4 = 9
* Possible cards for the river: 52 - 6 = 46
* There is 9/46 (approximately 20%) chance for the river to be a club
* You win 20% of the time and can win $70 ($50 in the pot and $20 from opponent's bet, ignore the $20 you need to put in the pot)
    * 0.2 * 70 = $14
* You lose 80% of the time and can lose $20
    * 0.8 * -20 = -$16
* EV = 14 - 16 = -$2

**DON'T CALL**

## Pot Odds

Pot odds are an easier way to calculate the previous example.

**Pot odds** = Total in pot after bet : Bet

**Odds against hitting** = # Cards that make you lose : # Cards that make you win

---

In the above example:

- **Pot odds:** 70-to-20 (3.5-to-1)
- **Odds against:** 37-to-9 (just over 4-to-1)

---

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Odds against > Pot odds | **FOLD** |
| Pot odds > Odds against | **CALL** |

### Call or Fold?

**Your hand:** A♥ A♠  
**Board:** A♣ J♣ 8♣ 4♣  
**Pot:** $150   
**Opponents:** 2 players (not including you)

---

- Safe to assume both players have a club in their hand
- Will cost you $50 to call (rest goes into side pot)

#### Pot Odds

**Pot Odds** = 250 / 50 = **5 : 1**

> *Why 250? The pot is $150 + opponent's bet that you're calling*

#### Outs

| Cards | Count |
|-------|-------|
| Aces | 1 |
| Jacks | 3 |
| Eights | 3 |
| Fours | 3 |
| **Total Outs** | **10** |

- 46 unknown cards in the deck
- 36 of them don't help

**Odds Against** = 36 / 10 = **3.6 : 1**

---

#### Decision

| Pot Odds | Odds Against | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| 5 : 1 | 3.6 : 1 | **CALL** ✓ |

Pot odds (5:1) > Odds against (3.6:1), so you should **call!**

---

> **Extra credit:** Odds against are actually 3.4-to-1, why?    
> The odds improve slightly to 3.4-to-1 because if opponents hold clubs, those clubs are removed from the deck, leaving fewer unknown cards (44 instead of 46).

## Don't Give Your Opponent Pot Odds to Call

### Bet Sizing Matters

- Imagine betting **1/3 of the pot** gives a flush draw odds to call (pot odds are exactly equal to odds against)
- Betting **more than 1/3 of the pot** does NOT give them odds to call
  - It would be a mistake for them to call ½ pot or ¾ pot bets

---

### Your Goal: Force Mistakes

> **You are the house. You want every edge.**

- Calling without the right odds is a losing proposition
- Your goal is to cause your opponent to make a mistake

---

### Key Takeaways

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Bet enough to deny correct odds | Give a drawing opponent odds to call |
| Force opponents into -EV decisions | Call when getting the wrong odds |

## Handy Outs Table

| Number of Outs | Drawing Hand |
|----------------|--------------|
| 4 | 2 pair, needing a full house; or inside straight draw |
| 6 | 2 overcards needing to make a pair |
| 8 | Open-ended straight draw |
| 9 | Flush draw |
| 11 | Flush draw plus a pair needing to improve to trips |
| 12 | Flush draw plus inside straight draw |
| 15 | Flush draw plus open-ended straight draw |

---

> **Rule of thumb:** 14 outs makes you even money against a better hand. And you will always be getting better than even pot odds from any bet. **NEVER FOLD. MIGHT EVEN WANT TO GO ALL IN!**

## Express Odds vs. Implied Odds

**Express odds (pot odds when all-in):** Simple math—what you risk vs. what you win. No future betting to consider.

**Implied odds:** Pot odds adjusted for future betting (since you aren't going all in and have some of your stack left over). Key question: How much will you win if you hit your draw?

- **Obvious draws** (e.g., flush draws) → opponents see them coming, harder to get paid
- **Hidden draws** (e.g., straight draws) → easier to extract value

---

### Example: Implied Odds in Action

**Setup:**
- Your hand: K♠ J♠
- Board: A♠ 7♥ 4♣ 8♠
- Pot: $180 | Stacks: $500 each | Opponent bets: $100

**Express Odds Analysis:**
- You're calling $100 to win $280 → 2.8-to-1 pot odds
- Flush draw = 9 outs out of 46 unseen cards → 37-to-9 ≈ 4-to-1 against
- **Express odds say fold**

**But consider implied odds:**

If you call and hit on the river:
- Pot becomes $380, you each have $400 behind
- If opponent bets or calls a bet, you win significantly more

**Implied odds calculation:**
- Need to win ~$150 extra on the river to justify the call (makes it 4.3-to-1 = (280 + 150)/100)
- Will opponent call a $200 river bet when a spade hits?

**Factors:**
- How likely will they pay you off?
- Will they recognize the flush draw?
- Could they call an all-in thinking you're bluffing?
- If they also have a spade draw, your implied odds are huge (and you're likely ahead anyway)

**Decision:** Calling is reasonable if you expect to extract ~$150+ when you hit.

# Lecture 3

## Starting Hand Selection Part 1

Your starting range is different for different situations:

* Unopened pot
* Raised pot
* 3-bet pot
* 4-bet pot

Opening types:

* Limp
* Raise
* 3/4-bet

Other things to consider:

* Strength of cards (obvious)
* Aggressiveness of table/opponents 
* Table image &rarr; What do the other people on your table think of you? Do they think you're aggressive? Do they think you're bad at the game?

Note: As the number of raises in the hand increase you will be a lot tighter. Why: If people are raising that means they have something strong, you want to make sure you can fight that. Earlier position also will make you tighter because you have less information.

### Analyzing Starting Hand Decisions

- Position is very important
- Action in front of you
- Player tendencies
  - Aggressive
  - Passive
  - Likely to 3-bet you light?
- Types of hands:
  - Premium, solid, speculative
- Stack sizes are critical
  - **Suited cards go up in value when deep stacked**
  - Small pairs go up in value when deep stacked
  - Position is more important when deep stacked
  - Premium cards go DOWN in value when deep stacked

### Entering a Pot

- Always come in for a 3x raise in unopened pot
    - Sometimes more in lower stakes games
        - E.g. 1-3 game, typical first bet is $12 or $15
    - Sometimes less (e.g. 2.5x) in tournaments towards the latter parts of the game
- Mixing it up (e.g. 70% raise, 30% limp) is debatable (Dan Harrington vouches for it though)
- Reasons for raising
    - You fold out the riff raff
    - You build a pot with hands you want to play
    - You can disguise the strength of your hand (same action regardless)

### Types of Hands

#### Big Pairs (QQ-AA)

- AA, KK, QQ
- Tend to win lots of small pots and lose big ones
- You probably have best hand &rarr; **YOU WANT TO RAISE AND RE-RAISE**
- Scenario: You have QQ on the button with 150 BB effective stacks
    - It goes raise, re-raise, re-reraise and then it's your turn. What do you do? &rarr; FOLD. You are either up against AA, KK, or AK.
    - What if it goes raise, then you re-raise, then it gets re-re-raised and back to you? &rarr; Read the player. If you think they likely have AA just fold.
    - What if you have KK in these scenarios? &rarr; Never fold (from prof's experience)
- Should you ever open limp? &rarr; NEVER
    - Unless you are at table full of maniacs
- What about open-limp or calling with AA?
    - A raise is better
    - Unless someone is consistently raising the limpers
- How much to raise?
    - Typically 3BB (more in lower stakes)
        - Re-raise 3x the previous bet
        - Example: UTG raises to $12 in a 1-3 game. You re-raise to $36.

#### Medium Pairs (66-JJ) Assuming Deep/Medium Stacks

- In early position
    - Open with a 3x BB raise
    - 50% of the time, call one bet if raised behind you
        - Depending on the player (fold to tighter player)
    - If it is 4-bet, you should fold
- Middle position
    - Same, but call a raise 80% of the time
- Late position
    - Same but always call a raise
    - If original raiser is loose/wild you can consider 3-betting
- If stacks are shallow (e.g. 20-30 BB)
    - A lot less playable
    - Why are you playing shallow??

##### How to Play Pocket Jacks

- Challenging because probably ahead pre-flop
- But flop will often bring an overcard
- Considered one of the hardest hands to play
- Old saying "There are 5 ways to play pocket jacks and none of them are correct"
- Sometimes safer to play like a small pair but you will not be maximizing your equity

#### Small Pairs (22-55) Assuming Deep Stacked

- Don't play shallow stacked
- In a weak game against weak players you can play them for one raise
- In a strong game against strong players only play in late position, fold if you miss the set on flop

#### Big Slick (Ace-King)

- It is a **drawing** hand, not a made hand
- Biggest strength is domination
  - E.g., against Ace-Jack or Ace-Ten
  - You hold the same card as your opponent but have a better kicker
- Common mistake: 3-betting too aggressively pre-flop in cash games
  - This forces opponents to fold the weaker hands you dominate (like A-10)
  - These are exactly the hands you want to play against to get paid off
- Strategy:
  - Short stack: Often best to shove all-in pre-flop
    - Realize your equity and see all five cards
    - Difficult to play post-flop if you miss
  - Deep stack
    - Be willing to fold pre-flop if facing heavy action (like a 4-bet)
    - You are likely up against Aces or Kings

#### Little Slick (Ace-Queen)

- Significantly weaker than Ace-King
- Strategy:
  - Still playable in most positions
  - Fold much more easily to serious action compared to Ace-King

# Lecture 4

## Starting Hand Selection Part 2

### A2-AJ

Perhaps the most **overrated** hand (both suited/unsuited).

* Overplayed by bad players
* Likely to be dominated by better Aces
* When you make a strong hand it's hard to get paid
    * It's obvious is you make nut flush for example

**Better to just fold most of these.** Save the negative implied odds.

How to play:

| Position | Action |
|-------|-------|
| Early | Play AJs, throw everything else away |
| Middle | Play AJ, AT, suited Aces at passive tables |
| Late | Played suited Aces and AT, do not play other Aces if pot is already opened. |

### Trouble Hands

This term was coined by Doyle Brunson.

* Trouble Hands are pretty looking hands like KQ, KJ, KT, QJ, QT.
* If you make top pair you feel good. But if you are dominated you are in trouble.
    * Easily dominated by AK, AQ, AJ, AT.
    * Some trouble hands are even dominated by each other (E.g. KQ > KT).
* **Don't call big raises with these hands.**

How to play:

| Position | Action |
|-------|-------|
| Early | Maybe play KQs, but toss the rest. |
| Middle | KQ, KJ, QJ can be played in an unopened pot (NOT LIMPING), but don't call a raise. |
| Late | Okay to play and raise, but be careful on the flop. Consider your opponent's tendencies. |

### Suited Connectors

* Hands like 23 and AK are less valuable than things like 9T &rarr; You can connect a straight from both ends with 9T.
* Good in deep stack cash games, **lower value in tournaments because they're tough to hit with a short stack.** 
    * **Forget about your suited connectors after the early stages of a tournament.**
* Play well as disguised hands. E.g. 89 has a big hidden draw with a 7T3 flop.

How to play:

| Position | Action |
|-------|-------|
| Early | Fold most of the time, raise high connectors (78-TJ) around 20% of the time. If there is a lot of 3/4 betting on the table, fold these more often. |
| Middle | Raise more often (maybe 50%). Also depends how active you've been (If you've been very tight lately, people would believe you have stronger cards this hand.) |
| Late | If unopened, almost always raise. Call one bet unless the blinds are known to be very aggressive. |

When to play:

* Try to be multi-way (when 3+ players are still in a hand) &rarr; Higher implied odds.
* Favor late position.
* Getting pairs are more likely than straights here. **Be willing to fold top pair on the flop because you WILL have kicker problems.**

### Other Playable Hands

- Mostly, only play these in late position
  - Occasionally raise with them in early/mid position for deception
- Unsuited connectors (e.g. 9To)
- Suited and unsuited one gappers (e.g. 97)
  - Suited or unsuited two gappers (e.g. 8T)
- Conditions for playing these:
  - Good position
  - **Tight table with lots of folding and little 3-betting**
- You want every flop to contain a threat
  - Opponent should know that if the flop is 10 8 7 that you might have two pair or a monster
  - They shouldn't always put you on AK or AQ
  - If you show down 96 for a straight, table will remember that and it will be harder for them to figure out your range

### All Remaining Hands

FOLD. Do not play garbage like J3, 82, K4, Q6, etc.

## Epilogue

The starting hand strategy described above is TAG (Tight and Aggressive).

LAG will play more hands:
* More disguised hands.
* More tough choices.
* More kicker problems.
* Needs to bully more but risk losing big more.

By playing TAG, more players will play tighter. You will be easier to read but will often have the better hand.

## The GAP Concept

**Sklansky's Rule:** You need a better hand to call a raise than the original raiser needed to make the raise.

Reasons:
* Raise was made from earlier position.
* Raiser could have opened anywhere in their range and you are not calling with the bottom end of your range.
    * Calling range is narrower than opening range.
    * If UTG1 raises, then UTG2 re-raises: You know UTG2 has a more narrow range than UTG1. Take this into account.
* Deeper stacks &rarr; GAP concept less important because you are playing for implied odds which tend to have weaker opening hands.

## Bet Types

### Value Bet

* You think you have the best hand and want to get more money in the pot.
* Usually 1/2 of full pot amount. If you think your opponent will only call a lower bet, then that's valid.
* Designed to:
    * Get more money in pot with the best hand.
    * **Make a worse hand to call.**
    * Deny good odds for other people's drawing hands.
        * They will either fold or put money in with negative expectation.
    * Take control of the hand.

### The Bluff

Opposite of a value bet.

- You think you don't have the best hand.
- **Goal is to make a better hand fold.**
- Sets up future bluffs on later streets.
- Gives you reputation &rarr; Makes it more difficult for opponents to read you later.
- **Bet size:** You want to bet the smallest amount that will do the job.
- Try not to overdo it. **Sizing should represent what you would do if you had a better hand.**

### The Semi-Bluff

A bluff but with a lot of outs.

- Semi bluff is a bet made by a drawing hand against a better hand
- Example: You have A♣ T♣
- Flop comes: K♣ 7♣ 2♥
- You bet, and if opponent has a pair, he calls
- You have an overcard to the board and nut flush draw
- So, we assume you have 12 outs (3 aces, 9 clubs) but you are behind
- If a blank comes on the turn, you can semi-bluff

Semi-bluffs are powerful but not to be overused

- Makes you hard to read – sometimes you have a monster and opponent will think you're semi-bluffing if draws are out
- Don't semi-bluff EVERY big draw
- A lot of players semi-bluff too much

# Lecture 5

## More Types of Bets

### The Probe Bet

Recommended by Harrington and is very common, but Avi doesn't like it much.

A probe bet is when:

- You don't know where you stand in the hand so you make a small bet to get information.
- Usually smaller than a normal value bet.
- Prevents the opponent from making a bigger bet.

### The Continuation Bet

- You were the pre-flop aggressor (you raised) and you bet again on the flop.  (Regardless of whether you hit the flop or not, 1/2 pot.)
- Why? 70% of the time you miss the flop and have two unpaired cards. Take advantage of the fact that your opponent likely missed too.

BUT, good players (and most opponents today) will recognize this and call you down lightly (don't forget the 70% also applies to YOU).

So:

- C-bets are **more effective in position** since you can see if your opponent checks first (meaning they likely missed the flop).
- Less likely to work multi-way since more players means more likely someone hit the flop.
- If you C-bet a lot, you get called more often. &rarr; Can be bad, but can be good if you have a strong hand and want to get paid off.

### The Donk Bet

- When you are out of position, your opponent raised pre-flop and you called.
- On the flop, you are first to act and you lead out with a bet instead of checking to your opponent.
- This is an unusual way to play:
    - You are giving up the advantage of seeing what your opponent does first.
    - You are representing strength when you likely have a weak hand (since you just called pre-flop).
- When to donk bet:
    - When you have a strong hand and want to build the pot.
    - When you have a drawing hand and want to semi-bluff.

### The Check

Goals of checking:

- You have a small value hand and want to see a free card.
- Keep the pot smaller when you have a marginal hand.
- Trapping with a monster hand &rarr; You have the nuts and want to induce bluffs or value bets from your opponent.

### The Check-Raise

- You have a good hand and up against an aggressive opponent who likes to steal pots (really good players do this a lot).
    - **You want to check-raise opponents like this.**
- If you have a bad hand and your opponent wants to steal the pot, you can **check-raise-bluff.** Same action, different strength in your hand.
- If you get check-raised, proceed with caution:
    - You are likely beat.
    - Only continue with monsters or strong draws.

### Post-Flop Play
