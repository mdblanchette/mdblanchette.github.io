# Module 1
## 1.1 A New Way to Argue
### 1.1.1 What Is Induction?

Inductive arguments are even more common in life than deductive arguments.

#### Types of Inductive Arguments

1. **Inference to the Best Explanation** &rarr; Who is most likely to have committed the crime?
2. **Arguments from Analogy** &rarr; Self-explanatory
3. **Statistical Generalizations** &rarr; Political polls
4. **Statistical Applications** &rarr; What do the generalizations from (3.) tell you about a particular thing?
5. **Causal Reasoning** &rarr; Science, root-cause analysis, etc.
6. **Probability**
7. **Decision Making**

#### Difference Between Deductive and Inductive Arguments

Deductive arguments are BAD when they are INVALID, but inductive arguments CAN BE GOOD even when they are INVALID.

Why?

**Deductive arguments are INTENDED to be VALID.** &rarr; The standards are Valid vs. Invalid. All or nothing.

**Inductive arguments are NOT INTENDED to be VALID.** &rarr; The standards are Strong vs. Weak. We look at *degrees* (a bit strong, kinda strong, moderately strong, very strong, and so on). Is the argument STRONG ENOUGH?

* Whether or not an inductive argument is strong enough depends on what's at stake. &rarr; When there's a lot to lose we need better reasons and stronger arguments.
* Context can weaken an inductive argument (change it from strong to weak), meaning that inductive arguments are **defeasible**. But deductive arguments are monotonic/indefeasible, meaning that no matter what premises you add to a valid argument it will still be valid.

#### Common Mistakes About Inductive Arguments

* **Many people think inductive arguments are inferior to deductive arguments. This can't be right, since you can take any inductive argument and turn it into a deductive argument.**

**Inductive Argument:** \
(1) Most of Joe's friends are seniors.    \
∴ (2) Joe is a senior.

We can make this argument valid by adding a conditional premise:

(1) If most of Joe's friends are seniors, then Joe is a senior.    \
(2) Most of Joe's friends are seniors.    \
∴ (3) Joe is a senior.

But this just shift all the doubts about the inductive argument into doubts about the conditional premise. So we haven't really been made more sure about the conclusion.

* **Many people believe that induction always takes us from the particular to the general.**

Induction generalization is one kind of inductive arguments, but it's not the only kind. (See Types of Inductive Arguments at the start of 1.1.1)

## 1.2 Generalizations
### 1.2.1 Generalizations from Samples

Generalizations are everywhere:

* "Almost all movies have credits."
* "Most popular bands have drummers."
* "Half of the people I know like to play sports."
* "3/4 of men eat burgers."

Generalizations are useful. When you feel sick, you need to know if most people who have similar symptoms need to see a doctor, and if a doctor can usually help you or not. This helps guide your decision-making. But, **how can we decide which generalizations to believe?** &rarr; You have to take a sample of some sort.

#### Types of Generalization

### 1.2.2 When are Generalizations Strong?

#### Questions to Ask About Generalizations

1. Are the premises **false** or **unjustified**? &rarr; Maybe the person that said the statistics lied about the number completely or happened to count them wrong?
2. Is the sample **too small** to say something about the population? &rarr; **The Fallacy of Hasty Generalization**. What is "enough" depends on what's at stake. If you're testing whether the parachutes works you will need to test a lot of them ofc, but if you're testing if apples float then testing just one apple is enough because of the biological context you have that all apples are built similarly.
3. Is the sample **biased**? &rarr; **The Fallacy of Biased Sampling**. If you walk into a cookie store and tell them you're going to taste test their cookies, the store might only give you their best cookies which is biased.
4. Was the question **slanted** (phrasing a question to make a result more likely than a true result)? &darr;

**A Slanted Poll**

_You are guaranteeing support or opposition to animal testing based on which of the two ways above you choose to ask the question._

_The options are weird to agree with and undesirable, the poll did this on purpose to limit the options and make most people pick the most sensible option (b). Notice how even the results are tricky, saying "primates" instead of chimpanzees to further influence the results._

### 1.2.3 Applying Generalizations

So you have a generalization of something, how can you apply this to make actual choices?

![](https://i.postimg.cc/59kMfpGJ/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-2-21-10-PM.png)

#### Standards for Applications

1. Premises must be true and justified.
2. Percentages should be very high or low.
3. No smaller reference class should conflict.

#### Fallacy of Overlooking Conflicting Reference Classes

![](https://i.postimg.cc/nzXYtHgq/Screenshot-2025-07-31-at-2-27-39-PM.png)

A general rule of dealing with conflicting reference classes is to **look at the smallest reference classes** as it gives you a better estimate of how likely it is that this individual has the general attribute. (E.g. Look at online teaching professors in this case).

But, as you get more narrow and narrow, it becomes harder to find data of what the exact percentage is. How do you know what % of online professors wear shoes when teaching?

**You have to balance and find that perfect point where you can narrow down the reference class reasonably enough that you still have enough data to be able to apply the generalization with sufficient confidence.**

## 1.3 Explanations and Analogies
### 1.3.1 Inference to the Best Explanation

Most common inductive argument: **Inference to the Best Explanation**.

This one is a weird one because it kind of combines **justification (giving a reason to believe the conclusion is true)** and **explanation (trying to understand why the conclusion is true)**. (See [here](https://mdblanchette.github.io/posts/think-again-1/#22-the-purposes-of-arguments))

Inference to the Best Explanation uses the argument to justify belief in the conclusion and yet, a premise of the argument is that that conclusion explains a phenomenon that you took for granted.

I'll be real ts was so hard to write, just watch it [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inductive-reasoning/lecture/cAMyP/inference-to-the-best-explanation).

#### An Example
![](https://i.postimg.cc/TwVsRkd6/Screenshot-2025-08-02-at-12-07-32-AM.png)

### 1.3.2 Which Explanation Is Best?

We need standards to determine when an inference to the best explanation is a good argument.

#### Standards of a Good Inference Argument 

1. Falsifiability &rarr; The explanation can be shown to be false
2. Conservativeness &rarr; The explanation does not conflict with well-established knowledge (e.g. laws of physics)
3. Power (or Breadth) &rarr; The explanation can explain many cases rather than only this one case
4. Depth &rarr; The explanation minimizes further questions that need to be answered
5. Modesty &rarr; The explanation minimizes its assumptions or claims

### 1.3.3 Arguments from Analogy

Examples of analogies:

* "Her eyes were like emeralds."
* "The new transportation system worked well in Houston, Houston is similar to Phoenix, so the system will also work well in Phoenix."
* "Segregated public high schools are unconstitutional in the US. Public colleges are similar to high schools, so segregated public colleges are also unconstitutional."

#### An Art Example

We can substitute letters to make a general form of argument:

![](https://i.postimg.cc/KjLLBLMm/Screenshot-2025-08-02-at-3-18-02-PM.png)

#### Standards of Strength

When does an argument from analogy give us a strong reason to believe it?

![](https://i.postimg.cc/4y3q3f7v/Screenshot-2025-08-02-at-3-23-07-PM.png)
_E: A weaker conclusion like saying "This is probably/There is a small chance this is also by the same artist" makes it less likely for the argument to be wrong._

#### Arguments from Analogy and Inference to the Best Explanation are Similar

![](https://i.postimg.cc/dtwmrH4X/Screenshot-2025-08-02-at-3-30-27-PM.png)

How do you decide which way to construct the argument? **Pick the one that makes the argument look best.**

# Module 2
## 2.1 What is a Cause?
### 2.1.1 Causal Reasoning

We need inductive arguments to support and believe causal judgements. E.g:

* Why did my screen suddenly turn black? &rarr; Laptop is old?/Website crashed?/Someone is pranking me?
* Which person committed the murder?

Behind these connections between causal events are **general principles**. (E.g. my phone will turn off when I press the side button, and turn on when I tap the screen.)

#### Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

## 3.5 Complex Conditions

**Complex Condition**: Conditions/features/candidates that are combinations of other candidates/features/conditions.

### Negative Test for Conjunctive Sufficient Condition

## 3.6 Correlation vs Causation

Consider this:

A runner runs a mile and it takes them 10 minutes. Why were they so slow? &rarr; Maybe because they were **heavy**.

But, weight can't be sufficient for running slow because everyone has a certain weight... It comes in **degrees**.

We can't use necessary/sufficient tests for things that come in degrees!

We need a test that deals with properties that come in degrees:

### John Stuart Mill's Method of Concomitant Variation

#### Correlations

"Concomitant variations" are also known as **correlations**.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/F15CB8Z1/Screenshot-2025-08-10-at-11-38-43-PM.png)

#### Causal Relations

When two features ARE correlated positively/negatively, there are four possible causal relations between them:
