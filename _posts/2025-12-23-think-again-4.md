# Module 1: Fallacies of Unclarity
## 1.1 Introduction to Fallacies

A fallacy is a kind of bad argument.

But not all bad arguments are fallacies. Some arguments are bad because their premises are false. But a fallacy is an argument that is bad because its premises don't support the conclusion, whether or not the premises are true.

## 1.2 Argument from the Heap

*The Sorites Paradox (or Paradox of the Heap) highlights the problem with vague terms, asking at what precise point a gradual change becomes significant, like when removing grains from a sand pile stops it from being a "heap". Starting with "one grain isn't a heap," logical steps suggest that any number of grains isn't a heap, contradicting reality.*

(1) A person who owns only one penny is poor.    \
(2) A person who owns only one penny more than a poor person is also poor.    \
∴ (3) Therefore, a person who owns 100000000 pennies is poor.

While this is valid in maths (Principle of Mathematical Induction). This is a **paradox**.

**Paradox**: An argument in which all of the premises seem to be obviously true, the argument seems to be obviously valid, and yet the conclusion seems to be obviously false. Some paradoxes are fallacies.

## 1.3 Vagueness

What is the linguistic phenomenon that gives rise to the paradox in 1.2? Vagueness.

**A expression is vague when there is no precise boundary between the cases to which it correctly applies and the cases to which it does not.**

## 1.4 Conceptual Slippery Slopes

**Conceptual Slippery Slope**: An argument that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that there is no significant difference between things that belong to a category and things that do not.

(1) A person who is 1m in height is short.    \
(2) A difference of 1mm is not a significant difference.    \
(3) A person who is 2m in height is tall.    \
∴ (4) Therefore, there is no significant difference between being short and tall.

This is a fallacy. Not because its premises are false (they're true), but the premises don't SUPPORT the conclusion. Differences that are significant can be made up out of a bunch of differences that are individually insignificant. That's why this argument right here is a fallacy.

## 1.5 Fairness Slippery Slopes

A fairness slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that it is unfair to treat cases that fall into a category differently from cases that do not fall into that category.

Example:

(1) A person who scores 100% on the exam passes.    \
(2) A difference of 0.01% is not a significant difference.    \
∴ (3) It is not fair to fail someone who scores a 10% of the exam.

This is a fallacy because it falsely assumes fairness requires no significant difference between scores, when in fact it can be perfectly fair to fail someone below a predetermined cutoff even if their score is nearly indistinguishable from passing. E.g. 60% is the minimum passing score but there is no big difference between 59.9% and 60.0%.

In everyday life, fairness slippery slope arguments often appear as the rhetorical question "where do you draw the line?"—which implicitly assumes that because small differences aren't significant, it can't be fair to treat slightly different cases differently, so beware when you hear this question as a fallacy may be lurking.

## 1.6 Causal Slippery Slopes

A causal slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that a particular event will lead to a calamity that is causally connected to it by a series of steps.

Example:

(1) If we let doctors euthanize patients under any circumstances, it is likely that we will eventually let them kill patients who are depressed or in severe pain.  
(2) If we let doctors kill patients who are depressed or in severe pain, it is likely that we will eventually let them kill patients who are a nuisance.    
(3) Doctors should not be allowed to kill patients who are a nuisance.  

---

∴ (4) Doctors should not be allowed to euthanize patients.

This is a fallacy because we are ignoring that the probability between the events may or may not reduce or be so unlikely that it doesn't justify worrying about the final outcome.

## 1.7 Ambiguity

**Ambiguity**: When an expression has more than one acceptable interpretation.

Examples: Bank, cardinal

Examples of ambiguous sentences: "She is an Asian historian", "Police kill man with axe"

### Why Ambiguity Leads to Fallacy

If an expression has two acceptable interpretations, and we switch between those two interpretations in the course of a single argument, then we can construct an argument that may seem valid, even though it isn't.

Example:

(1) Jones, I'm told, was sentenced to nine years in the violin case.    
(2) Our criminal justice system is not supposed to sentence anyone to spend time inside a violin case. 

---

∴ (3) Jones's sentencing was a breach of justice.

Another example:

(1) Amelia Bedelia was told to dress the chicken for dinner.    
(2) Amelia Bedelia could not find dinner attire small enough to fit the chicken.    

---

∴ (3) Amelia Bedelia was not able to do as she was told.

## 1.8 Semantic and Syntactic Ambiguity

### Semantic Ambiguity

When there are two interpretations of a certain word.

Examples:

"Gandhi stoned in rally in India." &rarr; Possible fallacy: "Gandhi is not qualified to lead."

"Iraqi head seeks arms." 

"Meredith is in a terrible state." &rarr; Possible fallacy: "Meredith is in Texas. Therefore, Texas is a terrible state."

### Syntactic Ambiguity

There are two interpretations of a sentence based on grammar.

Examples:

"The government asks us to save soap and waste paper."

"Tuna biting off Washington coast."

"Police can't stop gambling." &rarr; Possible fallacy: "Anyone who can't stop gambling need therapy. Therefore, police need therapy."

## 1.9 Fallacies of Equivocation

Ambiguity gives rise to fallacies of equivocation.

# Module 2: Fallacies of Relevance

## 2.1 Fallacies of Relevance and Vacuity

**Fallacy of Relevance**: When an argument's premises are not relevant at all to supporting its conclusion.

Examples: Ad Hominem, Appeals to Authority, Appeals to Popular Opinion

**Fallacy of Vacuity**: When you can't be justified in accepting the premises of an argument unless you've already independently justified in accepting the conclusion.

Examples: Circularity, Begging the Question, Self-Sealing

## 2.2 Fallacies of Ad Hominem

Ad Hominem in Latin means: "To the person."

**Ad Hominem Fallacy**: A fallacy that begins with premises about a particular person who is making an argument, and ends with a conclusion critical of that person's argument.

Example:

(1) Takahashi has given strong evidence that good US relations with Cuba will benefit both nations.    
(2) Takahashi owns a cigar business which would profit from these good relations.

---

∴ (3) We should disregard Takahashi's evidence.

### Types of Ad Hominem Arguments

Whenever people are making any point, they are doing at least one of those three things:

1. Implying that they are entitled to put forth claims about the issue.
2. Implying that certain premises support a conclusion on the issue.
3. Claiming that the conclusion is true.

Corresponding to each one of those three things is a type of Ad Hominem argument that denies that the arguer has successfully executed that thing.

#### Ad Hominem: Silencer

Begins with premises about a particular person making a point and ends with a conclusion that we should disregard the person's argument altogether.

#### Ad Hominem: Dismisser

Begins with premises about a particular person making a point and ends with a conclusion that the person's reasons are not good.

#### Ad Hominem: Denier

Begins with premises about a particular person making a point and ends with a conclusion denying the conclusion of that person's argument.

## 2.3 Silencers

Not all silencers are fallacies. Imagine: You are in the jury in court and yell "I saw him murder the victim! He is guilty!", the court will likely have to ignore your argument because it violates the proceedings of the court, despite it being a good argument or not.

These are just legal settings. Sometimes we need to also avoid silencers outside of that. E.g. We know someone is usually a liar, so we should disregard what they say. Or, this person has a criminal record, so we shouldn't believe instantly that they will be law abiding.

## 2.4 Dismissers

Some dismissers aren't fallacies. Imagine: A consultant wants maximize profits for a client. Since they are incentivized by maximizing profit, we shouldn't be certain that their reasons for suggesting cuts to cost on employees are strong enough.

## 2.5 Appeals to Authority

**Appeal to Authority:** An argument that begins with premises about a particular person who is making a claim, and ends with a conclusion endorsing that person's claim.

This is the opposite of an Ad Hominem argument which starts with the same premises but ends with a conclusion against that person's claim.

(1) Takahashi has given strong evidence that good US relations with Cuba will benefit both nations.    
(2) Takahashi was a good speaker and was very well dressed.

---

∴ (3) We should accept Takahashi's conclusion.

Reminder: Whenever people are making any point, they are doing at least one of those three things:

1. Implying that they are entitled to put forth claims about the issue.
2. Implying that certain premises support a conclusion on the issue.
3. Claiming that the conclusion is true.

Corresponding to each one of those three things is a type of Appeal to Authority argument that endorses that the arguer has successfully executed that thing.

### Types of Appeals to Authority

#### Appeal to Authority: Amplifier

Begins with premises about a particular person making a point and ends with a conclusion that we should accept the person's argument altogether.

#### Appeal to Authority: Supporter

Begins with premises about a particular person making a point and ends with a conclusion that the person's reasons are especially compelling.

#### Appeal to Authority: Affirmer

Begins with premises about a particular person making a point and ends with a conclusion affirming the conclusion of that person's argument.

## 2.6 Amplifiers

Sometimes amplifiers aren't fallacies. Imagine: A renowned scientist with a strong track record in climate science makes a claim about climate change. Given their expertise and credibility, it may be reasonable to accept their argument.

## 2.7 Supporters

Sometimes supporters aren't fallacies. Imagine: A medical expert presents well-researched evidence supporting a new treatment. Their expertise and the quality of their evidence may justify accepting their reasons as compelling. 

## 2.8 Affirmer

Sometimes affirmers aren't fallacies. Imagine: A respected historian presents a well-supported argument about a historical event. Given their expertise and the strength of their evidence, it may be reasonable to accept their conclusion as true.

## 2.9 Appeals to Popular Opinion

**Appeal to Popular Opinion:** An argument that begins with premises about the popularity of a particular claim and ends withs a conclusion endorsing that claim.

An example where this isn't a fallacy:

(1) Many people think that the verb "to emulate" is a synonym of "to imitate".     

---

∴ (2) Therefore, at least one of the meanings of the verb "to emulate" is the same as "to imitate".

It makes sense that human language should morph based on how people change the way they use it.

# Module 3: Fallacies of Vacuity and Circularity

## 3.1 Fallacies of Vacuity

A fallacy of vacuity is one that results when an argument starts by assuming what it is trying to establish.

### Types of Fallacies of Vacuity

1. Circularity: When the conclusion of an argument is one of its premises.
2. Begging the Question: When you have no reason to accept the premises of an argument unless you have already accepted its conclusion.
3. Self-Sealing: When an argument is constructed in such a way that no evidence could count against its conclusion, making it impossible to refute.

# Module 4: Refutation: Its Varieties and Pitfalls

## 4.1 Refutation

What is refutation?

**Refutation**: An argument that is intended to show that another argument is unsuccessful.

An argument may be unsuccessful because **we are not entitled to accept its premises**, or because **its premises do not support its conclusion.**

We can do the former by parallel reasoning, and the latter by counterexample or reductio ad absurdum.

### Pitfalls of Refutation

- We may end up attacking a straw man or relying upon a false dichotomy.
