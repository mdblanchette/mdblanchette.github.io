# Module 2
## 2.1 The Nature of Argument
### 2.1.1 What Is An Argument?

Arguments are **not** fights:
* You don't win arguments by hitting people in the head.
* You don't win arguments by yelling.
* You don't win arguments by insulting.

So what is arguing? Arguing is about asserting your views and giving reasons for them.

**Monty Python Definition:** An argument is a connected series of statements [intended] to establish a definite proposition.

BUT... Monty Python didn't get it fully right. The purpose of an argument isn't always about establishing propositions, because there exist propositions that we already knew. E.g: We already believe the Pythagorean Theorem, so proving it is NOT about establishing the proposition but more about UNDERSTANDING the proposition and explaining why it is true.

#### DEFINITION OF ARGUMENT
An argument is  \
(a) a series of **sentences, statements, or propositions**  \
(b) where some are the **premises** \
(c) and one is the **conclusion**   \
(d) where the premises are intended to **give a reason** for the conclusion.

## 2.2 The Purposes of Arguments
### 2.2.1 What are Arguments Used For? Justification

You would NEVER be persuaded by an argument that has only a conclusion but no premise. You need to be persuaded to believe the conclusion in some way.

**Persuading** is making people believe or do something that they would not otherwise believe or do.

But sometimes it's not about trying to change someone's belief, it can be about giving a reason for a belief they or we have.

**Justifying** is showing someone a reason to believe the conclusion.

Sometimes, the reasons given for a conclusion can be the same between persuading and justifying. The difference is in the **purpose**.

For example: "This car is a good choice because it is fast."
A salesman would use this argument to **persuade** you into buying the car.
A friend would use this argument to **justify** why a certain car might be a good choice.

**Another difference: Justification tries to give good reasons, but persuasion tries to change your belief or actions (and bad reasons can do that).**

#### Questions to Ask:
1. Is the arguer trying to change someone's mind? &rarr; Persuasion   
2. Is the arguer trying to give some kind of reason to believe something? &rarr; Justification

### 2.2.2 What Else are Arguments Used For? Explanation

Arguments can also be used to **explain** things, not just persuade or justify.

**Explaining** is giving a reason why something happened (or why it is true).

E.g. "Why did Argentina win the 2022 World Cup?" (Notice that when you explain something you **assume that it is true**. It wouldn't make sense otherwise.)
* **Key Difference:** When you persuade/justify something, your audience might not believe the conclusion. When you explain something, you and your audience both believe what you are explaining.

If we already know what is, what's even the point of explaining? The goal of explanation is to help people **understand** why something is true.

#### Types of Explanations (from Aristotle):
1. **Causal (Efficient Explanation)**: Why did the bridge collapse? &rarr; The earthquake shook it.
2. **Teleological (Purposeful Explanation)**: Why did Joe go to the grocery store? &rarr; To buy milk.
3. **Formal**: Why doesn't this peg fit in that round hole? &rarr; The peg is square.
4. **Material**: Why is this golf club light? &rarr; It is made of graphite.

These explanations help us understand why something happened.

**Explanation** is an attempt to fit a particular phenomenon into a general pattern in order to increase understanding an remove bewilderment or surprise.
* It is NOT persuasion, justification, generalization, or prediction.

## 2.3 The Materials of Arguments
### 2.3.1 What are Arguments Made Of? Language

The only things that can argue are the ones that can use complex language: Humans.

# Module 3
## 3.1 How to Identify an Argument
### 3.1.1 Argument Markers

#### Types of Argument Markers
1. Conclusion Markers (so, therefore, thus, accordingly...) &rarr; Identifies an upcoming **conclusion**.
2. Reason Markers (because, for, as, for the reason that, and the reason why...) &rarr; Identifies an upcoming **premise**.

* The categorization of these markers fundamentally comes down to CONTEXT, not the literal words.
* You can test this categorization by trying to substitute the conclusion/reason marker with another equivalent marker and seeing if it still makes sense.

## 3.2 Stopping the Regress
### 3.2.1 A Problem for Arguments

(1) There is at least one bacterium on Mars.    \
∴ (2) There is life on Mars.

This argument looks good: If the premise (1) is true, the conclusion (2) must be true. But... How do you know is (1) is true in the first place??

If you're just guessing the premise, the premise is not justified, therefore the conclusion is not justified.

**An argument cannot justify you in believing that the conclusion is true unless you are justified in believing that the premises are true.**

This leads to an infinite cycle where you need to back up your premises with arguments that have premises of their own that need their own arguments... and so on...

#### The Problem of the Skeptical Regress
![img-description](https://i.imgur.com/B3MfAQx.png)

#### Solutions
1. Start with a premise that is unjustified.
2. Use an argument with a circular structure.
3. Use an infinite chain of arguments.

**But the truth is that these are ALL problematic.**

#### Tricks for Dealing with the Skeptical Regress
1. Assure the audience by citing well-known assumptions or authorities.
2. Discount possible objections to your claim.
3. Guard your claim by hedging. ("It's probably/most likely right.")

### 3.2.2 Assuring

#### Types of Assurances
1. **Authoritative** &rarr; Cite an authority (someone with credibility) that you and the audience assume is true.
2. **Reflexive** &rarr; Talking about yourself: "I believe that...", "I know that...", "I feel sure that..."
3. **Abusive** &rarr; Making a conditional abuse that applies to you only if you disagree with them: "Everybody knows this...", "You'd be a fool not to believe it..."

Assurances are needed in general, but you need to be able to trust the authority you are citing to make your assurance.

#### Appeal to Common Sense (A type of Abusive Assurance)
"It's just common sense. You should believe this because everyone should know this."

#### Benefits of Assurance
1. They save you time.
2. **They help you avoid the skeptical regress.**

#### Tricks with Assurances
1. Citations of untrustworthy authorities.
2. Distractions **(Watch out for phrases like "That's obvious", "It's certain", "I'm sure")**
3. Dropping assurances (Sneaking in "fact" by slowly shifting from "It is reported that..." or "Sources have said that..." to "There are...")

#### We want an assurance when:
1. Someone might question the assurance.
2. The audience accepts the authority.
3. It would be too much trouble to cite all of the evidence.

#### Assurances are not appropriate when:
1. No one would question the claim anyway.
2. The authority is not trustworthy.
3. When you are easily able to give the full explanation.

### 3.2.3 Guarding

**Guarding**: Weakening your premises to get people to agree to share your assumption.

E.g.

Instead of: \
(1) All nuclear power plants will explode.    \
∴ (2) We should not build any new nuclear power plants.

We guard it by hedging: \
(1) **I believe that** some nuclear power plants **might** explode.    \
∴ (2) We should not build any new nuclear power plants.

**Key Question**: How much can we weaken the premise before it is too weak to believe?

#### When you see someone guarding, ask yourself:
1. Why did they put in the guard?
2. Have they weakened the premise so much that the conclusion no longer follows?

#### Types of Guarding
1. Extent
2. Probability
3. Mental

#### Guarding by Extent

"We need a new alcohol officer on our campus because **all** students drink too much."

We can guard this by changing "ALL students" &rarr; "Most", "Many", "Some students"...

By changing ALL to a less decisive wording, we weaken the premise beyond what would otherwise be expected in the context. Now it's harder to refute.

#### Guarding by Probability

"It is **absolutely certain** that OJ Simpson killed his wife."

&darr;

"It is **likely** that OJ Simpson killed his wife."

&darr;

"**There is a chance** that OJ Simpson killed his wife."

&darr;

"OJ Simpson **might have** killed his wife."

Where do we draw the line in the certainty where the accused should be convicted or not?

#### Mental Guarding

"I **know** that the President is 50 years old."

&darr;

"I **believe** that the President is 50 years old."

&darr;

"I **tend to believe** that the President is 50 years old."

&darr;

"I am **inclined to believe** that the President is 50 years old."

### 3.2.4 Discounting

**Discounting**: Citing a possible criticism in order to reject or counter it.

Imagine you want to buy a ring:

"I want to buy that ring because it's very beautiful."

The person may object: "But it's really expensive."

So you instead say this before the person can object: "The ring is expensive but it's beautiful."

You are now citing the objective which makes it less likely that the person on the other side will oppose you buying the ring because it is expensive. It's like saying that you know that already and have already weighed the pros and cons.

The sentence: "The ring is expensive but it's beautiful." does four things:
1. It asserts (or admits) that the ring is expensive.
2. It asserts that the ring is beautiful.
3. It contrasts the two claims.
4. It emphasizes the second claim about beauty.

The "but" indicates that the sentence after it is **more important** than the sentence before it. Using "and" instead would indicate that they are of equal importance. Using "but" makes the sentence non-reversible, but using "and" does make it reversible.

#### Functions of Discounting Terms
They:
1. assert two claims.
2. contrast the two claims.
3. emphasize one of the claims.

**The Trick of Discounting Straw People**: The arguer discounts easy objections to make people forget to think about the more difficult objections. Watch out for this!

Arguers can combine this trick with misuses of guarding and assuring:   \
"The President is in favor of a public health service, but a public health service is not going to solve **all** of the medical problems of our people."

Who said this is expected to solve ALL medical problems? You are putting the **unguarded term** in the mouth of the objector to make their view more susceptible to refutation and make it easier for you to argue your point.

**One Rule of Thumb: Think about the objections that the arguer is not considering.**

### 3.2.5 Evaluating

Evaluation is also used to stop the Skeptical Regress.

Consider "This policy is **good**" or "It's immoral to eat **fish**", you could then be asked WHY? WHY is it good? WHY is it immoral? &rarr; **Skeptical Regress**

We can typically address these by citing certain **standards**. i.e. "eating fish violates **this** ethical standard.", this avoids the Skeptical Regress.

**One Trick**: When we call something "good", we don't specify what the standards are. Ironically, we can stave off the Skeptical Regress if we leave out this specification and **allude to it via context**, making our claim more defensible since **the specific standards cannot be questioned if they are not presented.**

**Another Trick**: We don't have to agree on what the standards are.    \
Imagine you and a friend are driving together and you both think you should turn left. However, you think you should turn left to reach the destination faster, but your friend thinks you should turn left because the scenery is prettier. You both don't agree on the standards but still share the same conclusion.

#### Levels of Evaluation
1. General (Good/Bad, Should/Should Not, Right/Wrong...)
2. Specific (Beautiful/Ugly, Cruel/Kind, Brave/Cowardly...)

#### Why are these words evaluative?
What makes them evaluative is because we can link them to some form or favorable or unfavorable definition like good/bad.

But, there can be some trickier cases. Imagine a conservative politician calling a democrat's policy too "liberal". Is this evaluative? Note that the democrat and argue in return saying: "What's so wrong with a liberal policy?", "So what?", "Are all liberal policies bad?"

Therefore, we call language "evaluative" only when it is **openly and literally** evaluative and NOT when it is only contextually evaluative.

#### Slanting
**Slanting** is using evaluative terms without having reasons for the evaluation. E.g. calling someone "an idiot" or "foolish" without any evaluative reason that calls for it.

While this is bad, BUT this is a good indication to you as a critic that **that's the precise point which their argument is probably weak**. They're using that language to **hide where their real weakness is** in their argument. Look for these signals!

# Module 4
## 4.1 Validity and Soundness
### 4.1.1 Validity

#### Standards for Evaluating Arguments
1. Validity
2. Soundness

There are two main ways for arguments to go wrong (VICES in arguments):
1. One or more premises are **false**.
2. The premises do not provide a **good reason** for the conclusion.

By avoiding these, we can reach the two VIRTUES in arguments: Validity and Soundness.

#### Relation Between Premises and Conclusion
1. **DEDUCTIVE Argument**: The conclusion follows from the premises. &rarr; This is hard to pin down, so logicians focus on validity, i.e. **a deductive argument is supposed to be valid**.
2. **INDUCTIVE Argument**: Argument is not supposed to be valid (will be looked at later in the course).

So, what is VALIDITY?

Imagine:    \
(1) Mary has a child who is pregnant.   \
(2) Only daughters can become pregnant. \
∴ (3) Therefore, Mary MUST have at least one daughter.

An argument is VALID if and only if it is not possible that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false.

But... the word “possible” is tricky. How do we know what is and isn’t possible?

### 4.1.2 Soundness

You might be thinking: If valid arguments can have false premises, then what good are they? You could have horrible arguments that are still valid.

When a **valid** argument has **true premises** &rarr; You get **Soundness**. 

Because:
1. All the premises are true.
2. It is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.
3. Therefore, the conclusion must be true.

So, an argument is **SOUND** if and only if:
1. All of its premises are true, and
2. it is valid.

## 4.2 Revealing the Basic Structure
### 4.2.1 Get Down to Basics

The goal of reconstruction is to put an argument in a form in which we can easily and accurately assess it in as fair a manner as possible.

#### Reconstruction Process
**STAGE I: CLOSE ANALYSIS** \
Step 1: Do a close analysis.

**STAGE II: GET DOWN TO BASICS**    \
Step 2: Remove all excess verbiage (words). \
Step 3: List all explicit premises and conclusion in standard form.

**STAGE III: SHARPEN EDGES**    \
Step 4: Clarify those premises where needed.    \
Step 5: Break up premises where possible without distortion.

**STAGE IV: ORGANIZE PARTS**    \
Step 6: Divide the argument into sub-arguments and arrange them in order.

**STAGE V: FILL IN THE GAPS**   \
Step 7: Assess whether each argument is valid.  \
Step 8: Add supressed premises where needed.    \
Step 9: Check each premise for truth.   \
Step 10:  Qualify premises to make them true where needed if possible.

**STAGE VI: ASSESS THE ARGUMENT**   \
Step 11: Conclude.  \
11.1 If you find a sound reconstruction, accept the conclusion, since it must be true.  \
11.2 If you try hard enough but fail to find a sound reconstruction, then it is often reasonable to conclude that the argument is not sound.


#### Examples of Excess Verbiage
**Road Markers**: Saying why a topic is important and worth talking about. This is helpful for keeping track of an argument but does not add anything to the argument itself.

**Tangents**: Yapping a bunch about something without getting straight to the reasons for an argument.

**Red Herring**: Producing tangents to distract you from the main line of argument because they know that argument is weak and they don't want you to notice it.

**Examples**: Using examples that are tangentially relevant to the main argument to sway you away from the central point.

### 4.2.2 Sharpen Edges

We don't seek **ABSOLUTE** precision/clarity when forming arguments, but rather **ADEQUATE** precision/clarity. We want to clear up parts of the premises and conclusions that people are likely to be confused by later.

"We need to help the needy."

Who's we? Who says it's necessary? What do you mean by help? Who classifies as needy? There are so many different ways to interpret this, and we need to clarify exactly what we mean when forming the right argument.

Break up premises that have AND, but do not break premises connected by OR.

### 4.2.3 Organize Parts

After identifying the premises and removing the unnecessary stuff, we need to put them in a coherent order.

#### Linear Structure

![](https://i.postimg.cc/tCj2wTn1/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-11-33-14-AM.png)

#### Branching Structure

![](https://i.postimg.cc/Y9dsMwcc/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-11-32-26-AM.png)

#### Joint Structure

![](https://i.postimg.cc/0NhBKYkt/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-11-42-07-AM.png)

#### Branching vs Joint Structure

**Branching Structure**: The premises provide *INDEPENDENT* support for the conclusion.

**Joint Structure**: The premises work *TOGETHER* to provide support for the conclusion. Neither premise alone is sufficient for the conclusion.

#### Combining Structures

![](https://i.postimg.cc/zGvNnkN5/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-11-44-26-AM.png)

![](https://i.postimg.cc/4yYv6MWV/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-11-45-20-AM.png)

![](https://i.postimg.cc/4dqPSs7B/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-11-45-58-AM.png)

#### The Method

1. Identify and number the premises and conclusion.
2. When premises work together, put a plus sign between them and draw a line under them.
3. Draw arrows from reasons to claims that they are reasons for.
4. Rearrange as necessary.

## 4.3 Completing the Argument
### 4.3.1 Fill in Gaps
Step 7: Assess whether each argument is valid.  \
Step 8: Add supressed premises where needed.    \
Step 9: Check each premise for truth.   \
Step 10:  Qualify premises to make them true where needed if possible.

What do you do when you assess the argument for validity and you find out it's not valid? &rarr; **Add suppressed premises, enough of them to make the argument valid.**

#### Reasons to Fill in Suppressed Premises
1. To examine and assess the assumptions of the argument.
2. To understand the argument better. We can trace the reasoning between arguments.

#### Goals of Filling in Suppressed Premises
1. To trace the full path of the arguer's reasoning.
2. To find out if there are any missteps in the argument.

#### Example

![](https://i.postimg.cc/Dwy4YYGD/Screenshot-2025-07-11-at-11-07-10-AM.png)

In standard form:
![](https://i.postimg.cc/MHmX9ypq/Screenshot-2025-07-11-at-11-07-49-AM.png)

Let's break this argument into steps.

**Step 1**
![](https://i.postimg.cc/prCXfRsd/Screenshot-2025-07-11-at-11-09-24-AM.png)

This argument is **invalid**. It is possible for the premise to be True (the box does rattle) but for the conclusion to be False (the box does have a sweater). How? The wife could have put a sweater in the box with some small rocks to trick the husband with rattling sounds.

How do we add a **suppressed premise** to make this argument **valid**?

![](https://i.postimg.cc/bw9cd3Fz/Screenshot-2025-07-11-at-11-14-03-AM.png)
_1.* is the suppressed argument._

This argument is now **valid**. We can't set the conclusion to be false and keep the premises valid. I.e. if the box *does* contain a sweater (2.), then a box that contains a sweater should not rattle when shaken (1.*), but this box rattles when I shake it (1.). 1. must be false.

Now, how do we make this argument **sound**? Look at:   \
Step 9: Check each premise for truth.   \
Step 10:  Qualify premises to make them true where needed if possible.

#### Types of Suppressed Premises
1. Factual (E.g. Person A and Person B were both born on the same day.)
2. Moral (E.g. You ought to obey your mother if she is not abusive or stupid.)
3. Norm-based (E.g. You are jewish, you ought to go to the Synagogue on the Sabbath.)
4. U just know (E.g. You share a grandparent with your first cousin.)
