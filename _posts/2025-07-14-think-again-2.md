# Module 2
## 2.1 Deductive Logic
### 2.1.1 Introduction to Deductive Logic

**Deductive Argument**: An argument that is *presented* as valid. (Remember: Valid arguments have no possible way for the conclusion to be false when the premises are true.)

**Inductive Argument**: Arguments that are not presented as being valid but strong. These are successful only to the extent that they *are* strong.

### 2.1.2 Propositions and Propositional Connectives

**Proposition**: Something that can be either true or false, and that can be premise or conclusion of an argument.

Not a proposition:
* Binoculars
* A hand

Is a proposition:
* The binoculars are in my hand. (This is something that can be **true** or **false**.)

**Propositional Connective**: Something that takes propositions and makes **new** propositions out of them.

Example: "and"
1. I am holding the binoculars.
2. I am looking through the binoculars.
* I am holding the binoculars **and** looking through them.

### 2.1.3 "And" and the Truth-Functional Connectives

**"and"** can mean a lot of things.

Consider: *"I took a shower and got dressed."*    \
There is a sort of **temporal** order to this. You take the shower first THEN get dressed. It wouldn't make sense the other way around.

Now consider: *"I am holding the binoculars and looking through them."*   \
Here, there is no sense of temporal order. This time, "and" is a **truth-functional connective**.

**Truth-Functional Connective**: A propositional connective that makes a new proposition whose truth or falsity depends solely on the truth or falsity of its propositional ingredients.

_The truth or falsity of "Jack and Jill talked" depends on nothing other than the truth or falsity of the two connected propositions._f

### 2.1.4 Using Truth Tables to Show Validity

#### Conjunction Elimination Argument

_Can still refer to the AND truth table for this^_

### 2.1.5 Rules Variables and Generality

Rules are **general**.

"Stop hitting your brother right now!" &rarr; NOT a rule, but a command. "Right now" applies to a particular situation.

"You should never hit another person." &rarr; A rule! So is: "You should never hit your brother." &rarr; This rule applies to a multitude of possible situations.

#### Expressing Even More Generality

#### Notation for Truth-Functions

**Conjunction**: &

**Disjunction**: V

**Negation**: ~ or Â¬

### 2.1.6 Disjunction

**Inclusive OR**  \
"He is a math major or physics major" &rarr; It is possible to be both.

**Exclusive OR** \
"Either Manchester won or Barcelona won." &rarr; They cannot BOTH win.

## 2.2 Conjunctions and Disjunctions
### 2.2.1 Negation and Truth Functional Operators

**Propositional Operator**: Converts one proposotion into another proposition. (e.g. "I believe that...")

**Truth-Functional Operator**: A *propositional operator* that creates propositions whose truth depends solely on the truth of the proposition to which the operator is applied.

#### Negation
You know this lol

### 2.2.2 Commutativity and Associativity

**Commutativity**: A function of two things that delivers the same results no matter what order it operates on those things.    \
E.g. Addition, multiplication. Subtraction is NOT commutative.

**Associativity**: A function of three or more things that delivers the same result no matter what order it operates on those things.
E.g. Addition, multiplication. Subtraction is NOT commutative.
